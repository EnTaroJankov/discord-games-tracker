# discord-games-tracker

A Discord bot for aggregating game results posted in text channels and presenting per-user and aggregate statistics. It includes a Wordle reference implementation and a generic core designed to support other games.

## Features

- Pluggable game architecture (generic core + per-game plugin)
- Robust message parsing with fallback for plain-text `@handles`
- Generic result model using `score` (works across games)
- Wordle-specific stats and visuals:
  - Per-user leaderboard with totals, streaks, and averages
  - Lifetime, 30-day, and 7-day average (numeric scores only; excludes 'X')
- Calendar visualizations:
  - Send side-by-side calendars of the last N months (N â‰¤ 12)
  - One Discord message per user (optional delay, user filtering)
  - Emoji or ASCII rendering (ASCII recommended for perfect alignment)
  - Unique colors for Wordle outcomes:
    - 1 â†’ ðŸŸ©, 2 â†’ ðŸŸ¦, 3 â†’ ðŸŸ¨, 4 â†’ ðŸŸ§, 5 â†’ ðŸŸ¥, 6 â†’ ðŸŸ«, X â†’ ðŸŸª
    - Missed days are â¬›, future days are blank
